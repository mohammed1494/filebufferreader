Los Angeles Lakers star big man Anthony Davis intends to stay put once free agency opens, reports Shams Charania of The Athletic.
Davis has a player option in his contract for the 2020-21 season and, per Charania, will reportedly opt out of that deal when free agency opens. However, Davis will not be on the market long as he plans to re-sign with the Lakers. Charania adds that Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, will hold meetings in the coming weeks to discuss contract options.
